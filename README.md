This is a simple Perl program to find 4-letter sequences of all possible sequences for each word in a dictionary file.

The program will ask for the dictionary file name as input and will create the corresponding "words" and "sequences" files 
in the the working directory.

Simply run the letterSequencer.pl from the commandline.
